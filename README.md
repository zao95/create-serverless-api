# Create Serverless API

Create Serverless APIs with no infra configuration.

It is an aws serverless-based backend api template created for beginners.

You can service api without knowing the cloud infrastructure.

And Create Serverless API works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Create Serverless API was inspired by the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🚀Quick Overview

📌 Before we proceed with the work below, you must set [aws credential](#detail-usage)

    ```
    npx create-serverless-api my-api
    cd my-api
    npm bootstrap
    npm deploy
    ```

And Check the api endpoint output to the terminal.

You will have a fully operational api service.

For detail, please refer to the explanation below.

## ✨Feature

-   Automatic aws infrastructure completion through documents in the OpenAPI specification.
-   Install only essential packages for each API.

### Detail Feature

✨ The detail feature roughly say that this package is very cool.

-   Infrastructure distribution through IaC makes it easy to modify.
-   Using FaaS, monitoring is easy and stability can be obtained by horizontal expansion.
-   Supports monitoring and logging with aws X-ray and aws CloudWatch.
-   Babel settings are set for using typescript.
-   Can execute local test similar to the aws lambda.

## Basic Environment

-   ⚠ Caution
    Following this usage, your api will be serviced as a cloud service.
    You spend money according to the amount of api calls.
    **so make sure to check out [AWS Pricing Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing)**.

1.  Login to [aws console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

2.  Make iam user through [aws IAM users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users).

    -   Need **Access key** credential type.
    -   Recommend **AdministratorAccess** policy through the attachment policies directy button for easy work.
    -   Save the access key ID and secret access key that came out like that.

3.  Configurate your aws credentials file

    ✅ **Windows** default path: C/Users/{userName}/.aws/credentials
    ✅ **Linux** or **macOS** default path: ~/.aws/credentials

    ```text
    [development]
    aws_access_key_id={your_aws_access_key_id}
    aws_secret_access_key={your_aws_secret_access_key}

    [production]
    aws_access_key_id={your_aws_access_key_id}
    aws_secret_access_key={your_aws_secret_access_key}
    ```

    📌 If you want to change the name, please change it with the script of package.json

4.  nodeJS modules install

    ```
    npm i
    ```

    npm run bootstrap

    // Production
    npm run bootstrap-prod
    ```

6.  Deploy to aws

    ✅ The api is served on the address output to the terminal, **so make sure to save it**.

    ```
    // Development
    npm run deploy

    // Production
    npm run deploy-prod
    ```

-   Local execute

    ```
    npm run offline
